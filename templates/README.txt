OK, so this is confusing, and I am going to explain how this works:

For example, we need to display the "success" page, which gives the final short link and QR code. First, we take the tynilink_template.html file (which happens in other.py/display). Then, we replace the %s's in the file with the files from the "success" folder. These files contain the text on the page that never changes, like "Created URL successfully!". Then, we replace the %s's in those files with the parameters passed to unstatic.py, like the short url, and after all that, we send the page to the user.
