            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            <p>Tyni.link is a service that lets you shorten long urls like
              "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1su0sOYptfFfMlxnDsXpCfrtwvnPby4Gop_rX4haHSTw/edit"
              to short, sweet urls like tyni.link?d=MyHome. Unlike most
              shorteners, which produce urls similar to goo.gl/zf0I5, Tyni.link
              lets you choose your own, readable, urls, like the one mentioned
              above. It also provides different functions like tracking, link
              monetization, QR code generation and more.</p>
            <h3>Why is it better than others?</h3>
            <p>Have you ever been in a situation where you have to write down a
              link on paper (school project citation, notes, etc.)? Than you
              would understand how unhandy it is to write randomly generated
              codes like goo.gl/zf0I5: l's look like I's, 0's look like O's,
              etc. Also the same happens when you try to say the link to
              someone: random codes are just too easy to forget. With tyni.link
              YOU make the code, so you'll never have problems like that again.</p>
